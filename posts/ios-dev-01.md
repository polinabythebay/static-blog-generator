Taking steps to become an iOS developer.

Starting the bitfountain iOS 7 immersive course. This uses Xcode 5.1.1 and Objective C. I thought this would be beneficial because a lot of apps still use ObjC and some companies may even still be on 5.1.1 and I want to know what the differences are. 

The phases for me are:

Phase 1: Self instruction

1. Do Bitfountain courses on my own (iOS 7 and 8)
2. Go through Objective C Nerd Ranch book

--> get exposure to ObjC and multiple versions of Xcode. Blog about it. 

Phase 2: Apprenticeship

1. Enroll at Bloc and build several apps with the help of a senior developer
2. Network

Phase 3: Interview for an entry level iOS developer gig
